# For this project I downloaded a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
# I performed analytics on the data using SQL.


#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country !='USA';


#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country ='Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil.  The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT customers.CustomerId, customers.FirstName, customers.lastname, invoices.InvoiceId, invoices.Invoicedate, invoices.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers
JOIN chinook.invoices
ON customers.CustomerId=invoices.CustomerId
WHERE customers.Country='Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title='Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE BillingCountry != 'USA' OR 'Canada'
GROUP BY BillingCountry;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT employees.EmployeeId, employees.lastName, employees.FirstName, invoices.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees
JOIN chinook.customers
ON customers.SupportRepId=employees.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices
ON customers.CustomerId=invoices.CustomerId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, customers.Country, employees.LastName, employees.FirstName, invoices.Total
FROM chinook.customers
JOIN chinook.employees
ON employees.EmployeeId=customers.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices
ON customers.CustomerId=invoices.CustomerId;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT invoice_items.InvoiceLineId, tracks.Name
FROM chinook.tracks
JOIN chinook.invoice_items
ON invoice_items.TrackId=tracks.TrackId;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT ar.name as Artist, t.Name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT tracks.Name AS 'Track', albums.Title AS 'Album', media_types.Name AS 'Media', genre.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks
JOIN chinook.albums
ON albums.AlbumId = tracks.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types
ON media_types.MediaTypeId=tracks.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres
ON genres.Genreid=tracks.GenreId;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT employees.lastName, employees.FirstName, SUM(invoices.Total) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees
JOIN chinook.customers
ON customers.SupportRepId=employees.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices
ON customers.CustomerId=invoices.CustomerId
GROUP BY employees.FirstName

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, SUM(invoices.Total) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees
JOIN chinook.customers
ON customers.SupportRepId=employees.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices
ON customers.CustomerId=invoices.CustomerId
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'
GROUP BY employees.FirstName
ORDER BY 'Total Sales' DESC LIMIT 1
